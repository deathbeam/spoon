Spoon is awesome new programming language, what combines the best things from [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org) and [Python](https://python.org). Spoon is open source, cross-platform and runs on top of [Haxe](https://haxe.org).

Projects written in Spoon can run natively on any platform that Haxe supports, so

  * Any platform on what you can run C++, so almost everywhere
  * Android/iOS/Windows Phone
  * Windows/Linux/Mac
  * Browser (NodeJS, HTML5, PHP, AS3)

**Spoon is still in heavy development and not usable yet, so feel free to help me and contribute**

## Installation
