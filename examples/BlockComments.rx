This is how block (multiline) comments look in Raxe.
You can plase as much text here as you want, you just must
terminate block comment with same number of hypnens as you
initialized it.

  If you want to use nested block comments, you must initialize
  block comment with different number of hypnens as you use in
  nested block comment. So now when we initialized block comment
  with 5 hypnens, we can do this:
  ###
  Nested block comment, hooray.
  ###
  And of course, you can always also do this:
  # Comment in block comment
  And now, we need to terminate it with same number of hypnens as
  we initialized it, in this case 5.
